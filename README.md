# Health_Risk_Assessment :-->

This file is a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a supervised machine learning classification workflow for health risk assessment using a Random Forest model. The project’s main objective is to predict a patient's health risk category based on various medical and lifestyle features.

# Project Description :-->

The notebook uses a medical dataset with features such as gender, age, smoker status, diabetes, heart disease, healthy diet, and other patient health information. Key steps covered in the workflow include:

Data Preparation: Loads health risk data and drops irrelevant columns to focus on significant health features.

Label Encoding: Converts categorical variables (like gender, smoker, diabetes status, heart disease, and diet) into numeric values for model compatibility.

Train-Test Split: Divides the data into training and testing sets to enable unbiased evaluation of the model’s predictive ability.

Model Training: Implements a Random Forest classifier to learn patterns in the patient data and classify individuals into risk categories.

Model Evaluation: Includes reporting with classification metrics and confusion matrix to assess model performance on the test data.

# Key Features :-->

Fully self-contained notebook with code, from preprocessing to modeling and evaluation.

Uses popular Python libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Practical demonstration for healthcare analytics and risk prediction.
